# Overview

This is a demo website showcasing [marmos](https://github.com/Juptune/marmos)'s ability to not only generate a standard documentation model from D code; but also the ability of its autogenerated TypeScript library to be integrated into a wider documentation generation setup.

This site in particular was generated by [marmos-docfx](https://github.com/Juptune/marmos/tree/master/dogfood/typescript) which is a dogfooded project used as a reference on how the generated TypeScript library can be used - in this case, for generating a documentation site using Microsoft's [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) tool.

Please use either the `Juptune` or `Phobos` links within the navbar to view the final results.
